[![Gem Version](https://badge.fury.io/rb/omniauth-classlink.svg)](https://badge.fury.io/rb/omniauth-classlink)

# OmniAuth ClassLink
Unofficial OmniAuth strategy for [ClassLink](https://classlink.com) integration.

# Installation

Add the gem to your application's Gemfile:

```ruby
gem 'omniauth-classlink'
```
And then execute:

```
$ bundle
```

# Usage

First, you need to have your OAuth2 application registered in ClassLink. After creating one, you'll be provided with access key and secret that should be used for configuring the gem.

```ruby
Rails.application.config.middleware.use OmniAuth::Builder do
  provider :class_link, 'your-classlink-access-key', 'your-classlink-secret', name: 'class_link', strategy_class: 'OmniAuth::Strategies::ClassLink'
end
```

Or, alternatively, if you use [Devise](https://github.com/plataformatec/devise), you can put this in the `Devise.setup` section:

```ruby
 config.omniauth :class_link,
                 'your-classlink-access-key',
                 'your-classlink-secret',
                 name: 'class_link'
```

Add to your user model's devise:
```
    devise
      :omniauthable,
      omniauth_providers: %i[class_link]
```

Place this link where you want to use it:

```
= link_to 'Sign in with Classlink', omniauth_authorize_path(:user, :class_link)
```
